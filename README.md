# Build A Home Cyber Lab 
Built a personal cybersecurity lab environment to simulate attacker/defender scenarios using Kali Linux and Windows 10 virtual machines.

Performed network scanning and enumeration with Nmap to identify open ports and services.

Used Wireshark to capture and analyze traffic between virtual machines, applying filters to detect anomalies.

Practiced basic penetration testing techniques and documented findings in a structured lab report.

Gained foundational hands-on skills in virtualization, secure configuration, and network traffic analysis.
